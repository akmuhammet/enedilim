========

A simple Go program that collects all turkmen words from [enedilim.com] (http://enedilim.com).  
My first Go exercise.  

I needed turkmen words with correct spelling to add to user dictionary  
for autosuggestion on my Android phone.  
I use [UDM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usr.dict.mgr&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS51c3IuZGljdC5tZ3IiXQ..) to import words to user dictionary on my phone.
